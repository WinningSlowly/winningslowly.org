### Show Notes

Chris and Stephen discuss the ethics of individual health, a complex and
idiosyncratic problem if there ever was one. How do we be responsible stewards
of our bodies? How do we think about activities and intakes in moral, ethical,
deeply personal ways? We suggest thinking about personal health in community, as
well as from a spiritual perspective.
