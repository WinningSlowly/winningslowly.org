### Show Notes

In which we talk about science journalism---the ways in which it is sometimes broken, the reasons why it ends up broken in those cases, and the responsibilities of scientists, scientific journalists, and the science-reading public in publishing and interpreting scientific findings. Science is hard. Reporting on it is hard. Making policy on it is hard. And we need all of them.
