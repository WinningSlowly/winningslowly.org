### Show Notes

In which we geek out about Doctor Who... and do our best to say something meaningful about the necessity of people who can tell us what we're getting wrong in life, and who can be strong where we have weaknesses.

#### Correction

We said only one episode of new Doctor Who has won a Hugo. We were *dreadfully* wrong: the show has won *six* Hugos since the revival in 2006.

Whoops.

#### Recommended Moffat Episodes of _Doctor Who_

- "The Empty Child" and "The Doctor Dances"
- "The Girl in the Fireplace"
- "Blink"
- "Silence in the Library" and "Forest of the Dead"
- "The Day of the Doctor" (fiftieth anniversary special)
