### Show Notes

In which we talk about headline-writing in general, click-bait headlines in particular, and why we don't think that click-bait headlines are a "best practice"---or really a good thing at all. How these realities shape all sorts of discourse, not just headline-writing, including political stances.

Note: Chris kept talking about Slate when he meant *not* Slate (and specifically "Pajiba.com"). *His bad.*
