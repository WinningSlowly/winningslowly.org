### Show Notes

Chris and Stephen take three recent articles about the super-structure of how
our society pays for college and scrutinize the issue. How does American society
value what college delivers? (What does it deliver?) How do we fund it? Should
we fund it? We take the time not just to ponder, but to celebrate an unlikely
organization that's doing some incredibly innovative moves in the space. Also
Stephen inadvertently insults a whole group of people. Sorry about that.
