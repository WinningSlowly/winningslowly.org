### Show notes

In which we talk about how context shapes (or *should* shape) our decisions
regarding technology, with three big topics:

- Christian author and former pastor [John Piper] and [Pope Francis] on Twitter
- Google acquiring Nest and the ensuing internet freakout
- Intentionally unprofitable bands and the changing shape of music industry, as
  highlighted by miniature label [Controlled Burn Records] and band [Nonagon]

[Pope Francis]: //www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/
[Controlled Burn Records]: //controlledburnrecords.com/
[Nonagon]: //nonagon.us

Sometimes we mention things in our show. When we do, we link them here. Makes it
easier for you that way... gives you some *context*, as it were.
