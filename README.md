=============

The public repository for WinningSlowly.org. Here we maintain both the 
public-facing HTML, in the `gh-pages` branch, and the nitty-gritty 
implementation details, in the `master` branch... as well as in-development
tweaks and changes to the site, in *other* branches.

We have made this public because we think that is a "winning slowly" thing to
do: the web is at its very best when it's open. That doesn't necessarily mean
everything needs to be free! It just means that when things don't have a reason
*not* to be free, sharing the wealth of knowledge around is a good thing.

All of this material is therefore provided, open source, so that others can
learn from, remix, and otherwise make use of it. There is just one restriction
on that: if you're going to use the material, please do us the favor of
crediting us for it. That's just being kind, but it's also the legal license for
the site: we use the MIT license for the technical side of things and the 
CC-BY 4.0 license for the content. For more details, and for the legalese, see
the [`LICENSE`].

[`LICENSE`]: https://github.com/WinningSlowly/winningslowly.org/blob/master/LICENSE

**Note:** The typefaces are *not* open-source, but available for purchase from
the genuinely excellent [Klim Type Foundry](https://klim.co.nz). As we say with
the music we use in each episode: please *don't* use these fonts without
permission; go buy them and support the excellent work of their creator instead
if you like them!

Neat!

To see how the site *works*, look at [the `master` branch], which has the
[Pelican] configuration, [Jinja2] templates, etc., as well as all the Markdown
files which constitute the content of the site (but before conversion).

[the `master` branch]: https://github.com/winningslowly/winningslowly.org/tree/master
[Pelican]: http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/
[Jinja2]: http://jinja.pocoo.org

To get the site itself, look at [the `gh-pages` branch]. Because of the way
[Pelican] and [GitHub Pages] play together, you can actually check out the site
from any point in time since we started podcasting (and, in fact, from *before*
we started publishing episodes). That may only be mildly interesting from a
content perspective, but it may be interesting if you are curious to see how the
site mechanics work, or see how the design of the site developed.

[the `gh-pages` branch]: https://github.com/winningslowly/winningslowly.org/tree/gh-pages

If you have any questions, feel free to ping [Chris] on [App.net] or [Twitter].
You could ask [Stephen], but he probably won't be able to tell you much apart
from how to write in Markdown.
