### Show Notes

Chris and Stephen do something different this week and read Alan Jacobs' 79 Theses on Technology (For Disputation) as an oral presentation. We throw in some thoughts at the end, thereby jumping into the conversation ourselves. But mostly we give Alan Jacobs the credit he is due and give his thoughts the space they deserve.
