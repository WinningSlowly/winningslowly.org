### Show Notes

In which we look (rather critically) at the tech sphere's tendency to assume everything not only can but should be disrupted. Snarky asides on smartwatches and smartshoes segue into a discussion of the necessity of humility and the importance of recognizing what technology *cannot* do and what it *should* not do.

*Note:* by "disruption" we are focused not on the particular concept developed by Clay Christensen, but on the popular view of the word. We are aware of the distinction, but decided to set it aside for the purposes of this particular episode.
