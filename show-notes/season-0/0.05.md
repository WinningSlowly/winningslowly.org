### Show Notes

In which we try out a 15-minute show format (and manage to run to 22 minutes, of
course---you're not really surprised, are you?) on one topic: Kickstarter
hitting a *billion* dollars funded.

#### Chapters

  - Kickstart All The Things (0:40--13:57): Kickstarter hits a billion dollars,
    so we wax eloquent about just how neat the whole project is.
  - Ungreedy Capitalism (13:57--22:05): We talk about how Kickstarter's business
    model and company structure are different in really good ways, and the
    history and future of capitalism.

### Music
