    After reading Carl Sagan’s 1985 novel _Contact_ and watching the 1995 movie of the same name, we discuss a major epistemological question: what are the acceptable grounds for belief?

### Show Notes

After reading Carl Sagan’s 1985 novel _Contact_ and watching the 1995 movie of the same name, we discuss a major epistemological question: what are the acceptable grounds for belief? Are religious belief and scientific proof compatible? Sagan's surprisingly nuanced views give us interesting ways forward.
