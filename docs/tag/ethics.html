            <i>Why is the site black right now?</i>
         </p>
         <p style='padding-bottom: 1em;'>
            The United States of America is confronting—again—the reality of both systemic
            racism and police brutality, which is disproportionately directed at people of
            color.
         </p>
         <p style='padding-bottom: 1em;'>
            Along with many other sites, we have turned this site black to point to the
            importance of black lives, and to express our solidarity with the people of
            color in this country, who have continually experienced racism in forms both
            subtle and overt for many centuries.
         </p>
         <p style='padding-bottom: 1em;'>
            We know that this kind of visual gesture is often just performative, and that
            too often it stands in for <em>actually doing something</em>. We make this
            small change as a visual symbol of our stance—but we’re also working in our
            own ways in our own communities to make things better, pursuing justice and
            peace. In our podcast, we will be discussing a book by a black feminist in
            July—a decision we made well before this latest moment of horrific injustice.
            Racism is a problem with deep and structural roots in American society, and we
            could not reasonably talk about the ethics and epistemology of technology
            <em>without</em> technology’s effects on racism and racism’s effects on
            technology in America and beyond.
