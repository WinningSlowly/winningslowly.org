### Show Notes

Chris and Stephen use the news of communications tool Slack's recent hacking
incident to discuss the nature of digital security. Along the way we make a plea
for candy, claim that almost all companies are digital companies now, offer some
security tips to our listeners, and deliver a long bloopers reel. We hope we
induce just enough paranoia to get things moving in your security life, but not
too much.

*Note*: The [digital divide](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide)
primarily has to do with socio-economic issues of development in rich and poor
areas. Our BYG discussion points out the structural corporate collusion that
enables the digital divide, which may not have been entirely clear.
