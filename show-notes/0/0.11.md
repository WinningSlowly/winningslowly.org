### Show Notes

In which we tackle copyright (or left, as you like), barely touch on patents,
and generally try to think about how to handle questions of intellectual
property as consumers and creators thereof in the brave new world of digital
economics and cheap copies of everything (even Nike shoes).

#### Chapters

  - Intro (1:02)
  - The Reason for Copyright (1:02--8:22)
  - Valuing Products in Different Ways (8:22--19:55)
  - "Pay Me For This Thing" (19:55--26:55)
  - Conclusion (28:10)

### Music

We know. Pretty sweet sounds. Even if we do say so ourselves.

  - ["New Life"](//themidnightsons.bandcamp.com), from _New Life_, by
    Stephen Carradini. Used because we can do whatever we want with our own
    music! (Turns out, in this case, so can you...)
  - ["Winning Slowly Theme"](//soundcloud.com/chriskrycho/winning-slowly),
    by Chris Krycho. See above!
