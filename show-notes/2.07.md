### Show Notes

Chris and Stephen "review" Rich Mullins' 1993 album _A Liturgy, a Legacy, and a
Ragamuffin Band_ because it's beautiful, thoughtful, and still relevant today.
The music is still passionate, raw, and wild; the lyrics are still pensive,
powerful, and awe-struck. We look at how Mullins wrote the album as a letter to
Christians about how to be alive in the hope of Christ and reality of America.
Also, there's hammered dulcimer.

Thanks to our listener Austin Taylor for [encouraging us to review more albums].
