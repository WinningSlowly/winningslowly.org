### Show Notes

In which we talk about one of the *longest* views: family. In particular, we
look at the ways that all our pursuits---especially those having to do with
family---force us to make choices about what we value most and to allocate our
time accordingly. After all, one's impact on one's family is far more
long-lasting than nearly anything else we do. We also spend some time thinking
about the responsibilities of corporations to develop expectations that support
families as genuinely valuable to culture
