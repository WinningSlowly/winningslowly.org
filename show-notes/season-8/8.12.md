Summary: >
    Digging into Simone Browne’s application of critical race theory to surveillance studies. We learned a lot here—and we talk (again!) about learning from folks with whom we have deep axiomatic differences.

### Show Notes

The two main subjects we mentioned on the show as relevant were [critical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory) (and specifically [critical race theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_race_theory)) and [surveillance studies](https://www.surveillance-studies.net/?page_id=119). Notably, while Browne describes herself as a [black feminist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_feminism) and makes reference to the adjacent idea of [intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality), she never explicitly refers to critical (race) theory. *We* applied the term to her based on her historical and interpretive methods.

Stephen reviewed our intro music, Joshua Crumbly’s “New Rock Thingy,” [here](https://independentclauses.com/joshua-crumbly-puts-himself-on-the-map-with-a-unique-space-and-voice/).

Finally (as noted on air), Stephen was *definitely* recording from a closet:
