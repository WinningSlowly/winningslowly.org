### Show Notes

In which we discuss the necessity of extending charity to each other in our
conversations, especially conversations on controversial issues. Springboarding
from public/internet reactions to Christian musician Michael Gungor's discussion
of his views on Genesis, we talk about the necessity of charity, Chris' Rules
for Argument, the importance of taking a long-term view on friendship and
persuasion, and what to do in the face of serious disagreement about important
issues.
