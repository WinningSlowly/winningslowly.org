### Show Notes

Chris and Stephen use Chris's first two ridesharing experiences as a jumping-off point to discuss services like Uber and Lyft from a host of angles: ethical, financial, technological, social, legal, and personal. Put on your seatbelts, folks: this one's a long one. 

*Note:* Chris told the drivers of his Lyft and Uber rides that he was going to talk about his experience on this podcast, and they agreed to talk with him.
