### Show Notes

In which we try out a 15-minute show format (and manage to run to 22 minutes, of course---you're not really surprised, are you?) on one topic: Kickstarter hitting a *billion* dollars funded.

#### Chapters

- Kickstart All The Things (0:40--13:57): Kickstarter hits a billion dollars, so we wax eloquent about just how neat the whole project is.
- Ungreedy Capitalism (13:57--22:05): We talk about how Kickstarter's business model and company structure are different in really good ways, and the history and future of capitalism.

### Music

- Opening music: ["It's Fine, It's Fine"][1], from _Westroy Sessions Volume Two_ by Daniel G. Harman. Used by permission.
- Closing music: ["Winning Slowly Theme"][2] by Chris Krycho. Used by dint of being written for the show.
