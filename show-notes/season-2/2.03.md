### Show Notes

In which we look at Zoë Keating's ongoing kerfuffle with YouTube. Is YouTube
strong-arming indie artists? Should megacorporations force all their
clients---customer and producer---to fit in a one-size-fits-all setup, or should
they take the long view and do what is best not only for the bottom line but
also for the relationship between artist and audience. Oh, and what about those
monopolies and monopsonies? They might have some extra ethical responsibility,
too!
