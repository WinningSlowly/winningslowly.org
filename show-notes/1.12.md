### Show Notes

In which we start with a look at some really neat apps designed to ease
political engagement in the United States and then branch out to talk about the
limits of political engagement, the importance of valuing other forms of public
life, and what it means to be fully-realized human beings.

#### Corrigenda

Chris said that Countable addresses local politics; it does not. It focuses on
national bills in the House and Senate. Also, he mentioned the Westminster
Confession but meant the Westminster Shorter Catechism.

    every time someone starts whistling this theme after listening to an
    episode. Or he would if he knew about it.
