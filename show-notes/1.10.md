### Show Notes

In which we talk about something Apple did this week... but not the thing they
announced, and almost certainly not what you'd expect. Namely: the death of the
iPod Classic: Apple's oldest consumer product outside the Mac, and a veritable
gamechanger for the music industry. It's gone, and Stephen is upset. (Chris, not
so much.)
