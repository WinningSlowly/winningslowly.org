### Show Notes

In which we talk at length about art and the arts in the context of
Christianity, taking the three religiously themed movies in theaters right now
as our jumping off point.

#### Chapters

  - _God's Not Dead_ (2:56--10:09) -- propositions in movie format, a.k.a. a
    tract.
  - _Son of God_ (10:09--18:45) -- moving higher on the art scale, and not
    trying to be big (in contrast with e.g. _The Passion of the Christ_).
  - _Noah_ (18:45--26:06) -- all art, not so much on the textual fidelity. We
    might be okay with that.
  - "Heaven Thrown In" (26:06--31:04) -- on how aiming to start a conversation
    sometimes has the opposite effect, and how making good art sometimes
    produces a great conversation.

  Stephen made a tent to record in his hotel room in Indianapolis. Some scratchy
  audio from the blanket ensued, but so did clean audio for his voice. See what
  we do for you listeners?
