### Show Notes

In which we ask: Is Elon Musk really Iron Man? (We have no evidence that he has
a suit, but really, it seems like he should.) We reflect on how longer-term
approaches are helping Tesla and SpaceX do things that few other companies are
doing, how we hope other companies learn from their example, and how it would be
nice if "capitalism" meant what it used to mean---long-term investment, not
short-term greed.

### Music

  - ["Just Like Moonlight"] by Inner Outlaws. Sounds like James Bond, perfect 
    for Elon Musk-as-Iron Man. Used by permission.
  - ["Winning Slowly Theme"] by Chris Krycho, who has been practicing piano so
    that he'll eventually be able to sit down at some glorious Bösendorfer or
    Steinway and dazzle you with a *real* version of this.
