### Show Notes

In which we talk about how companies have to deal with the inherent leak-ability
of digital media, especially things like movie trailers. How *should* Marvel
respond to whoever leaked the first Age of Ultron trailer? Stephen and Chris
have a friendly disagreement about the best way to respond to this kind of
thing.

Today's blooper section is... amazing.

Alternate title we ultimately decided not to foist upon you: MPAAwful. You can
thank Stephen for that one (as well as the much better actual title!)

  - [How much money has the Pebble Time Kickstarter raised?]---graphing the
    craziness for fun and... fun. (Unfortunately, the graph is less interesting
    than it was the first day the project was live, when it earned most of the
    over $10M it has pledged.)
