        <title>Winning Slowly</title>
        <link>http://winningslowly.org/</link>
        <description>A forum for two interdisciplinary thinkers to discuss the long view of current trends in technology, religion, art, ethics, and culture. There are plenty of podcasts that will tell you how Apple’s latest product will affect the tech landscape tomorrow, but there aren’t that many concerned with the potential impact of that tech in 2024. In a culture obsessed with now, how can we make choices with a view for tomorrow, next year, and beyond?</description>

<p>In which we talk about one of the <em>longest</em> views: family. In particular, we look at the ways that all our pursuits&#8212;especially those having to do with family&#8212;force us to make choices about what we value most and to allocate our time accordingly. After all, one&#8217;s impact on one&#8217;s family is far more long-lasting than nearly anything else we do. We also spend some time thinking about the responsibilities of corporations to develop expectations that support families as genuinely valuable to culture</p>

In which we talk about one of the *longest* views: family. In particular, we look at the ways that all our pursuits—especially those having to do with family—force us to make choices about what we value most and to allocate our time accordingly.

We also spend some time thinking about the responsibilities of corporations to develop expectations that support families as genuinely valuable to culture

In which we talk about how watching companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook try to “pivot”—that is, attempting (and usually failing) to do something outside their core areas of competency—highlights the difficulty of institutional change in general. We apply this idea to everything from the strengths and weaknesses of different Christian denominations to the way structural change occurs in the government.

A few explanatory comments:

• Yes, we’re fully aware that the PCA (to which Stephen belongs) has *lots* of missionaries on the field, and that Southern Baptists’ (of which Chris is one) views on alcohol are a great deal more complicated than just generic grumpiness. But those details are less important to the particular discussion we were having today.

How these realities shape all sorts of discourse, not just headline-writing, including political stances.</p>

            <itunes:subtitle>Headline-Writing, Whether Ends Justify Means, Means Shape Ends, Truthy, or Truly?</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary># Show Notes

In which we talk about headline-writing in general, click-bait headlines in particular, and why we don't think that click-bait headlines are a “best practice”—or really a good thing at all. How these realities shape all sorts of discourse, not just headline-writing, including political stances.

Note: Chris kept talking about Slate when he meant *not* Slate (and specifically "Pajiba.com"). *His bad.*

## Chapters

• Intro (1:26)
• Headline-Writing (1:26–6:58)
• Whether Ends Justify Means (6:58–12:30)
• Means Shape Ends (12:30–16:47)
• Truthy, or Truly? (16:47–21:07)
• Conclusion (21:07–22:10)

<h4>Chapters</h4>

<li><em>Noah</em> (18:45–26:06) – all art, not so much on the textual fidelity. We might be okay with that.</li>

<li>“Heaven Thrown In” (26:06–31:04) – on how aiming to start a conversation sometimes has the opposite effect, and how making good art sometimes produces a great conversation.</li>

<p>Aside: Stephen made a tent to record in his hotel room in Indianapolis (<a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/images/podcast-ghost.jpg">visual proof here</a>). Some scratchy audio from the blanket ensued, but so did clean audio for his voice. See what we do for you listeners?</p>

            <itunes:summary># Show Notes

In which we try out a 15-minute show format (and manage to run to 22 minutes, of course---you're not really surprised, are you?) on one topic: Kickstarter hitting a *billion* dollars funded.

## Chapters

- Kickstart All The Things (0:40--13:57): Kickstarter hits a billion dollars, so we wax eloquent about just how neat the whole project is.
- Ungreedy Capitalism (13:57--22:05): We talk about how Kickstarter's business model and company structure are different in really good ways, and the history and future of capitalism.

# Music

- Opening music: "It's Fine, It's Fine" (http://thetroublestarts.bandcamp.com/track/its-fine-its-fine), from _Westroy Sessions Volume Two_ by Daniel G. Harman. Used by permission.
- Closing music: "Winning Slowly Theme" (https://soundcloud.com/chriskrycho/winning-slowly) by Chris Krycho. Used by dint of being written for the show.
