### Show Notes

In which we geek out about _Doctor Who_... and do our best to say something
meaningful about the necessity of people who can tell us what we're getting
wrong in life, and who can be strong where we have weaknesses.

#### Correction

We said only one episode of new Doctor Who has won a Hugo. We were *dreadfully*
wrong: the show has won *six* Hugos since the revival in 2006.

Whoops.

#### Recommended Moffat Episodes of _Doctor Who_

  - "The Empty Child" and "The Doctor Dances"
  - "The Girl in the Fireplace"
  - "Blink"
  - "Silence in the Library" and "Forest of the Dead"
  - "The Day of the Doctor" (fiftieth anniversary special)
