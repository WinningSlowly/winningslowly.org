### Show Notes

Chris and Stephen note the launch of Tidal with some skepticism, then contrast
the service with what could be considered Tidal's polar opposite: YouTube. We
look at the international aspects of music distribution, and think about how
youth factor in to the ever-changing equation. And, good news, there's a happy
ending. I love happy endings.
