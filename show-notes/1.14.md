*Note:* if you downloaded this episode before 8:45pm Eastern time on
October 21, 2014, you should re-download it. Chris made an error in
mixing it together, leading to his and Stephen’s audio being slightly
out of sync for the entire episode (!), which has since been fixed. If
you downloaded it after that time, you’re good to go!

### Show Notes

In which we ask: "Who funds the arts? And how does that impact the
artist ethically?" Corporations, individuals, and governments all have
distinct downsides as revenue streams for artists, and corporations and
governments in particular can be problematic for both artists and
consumers in the ways they complicate the expression of artistic intent.
