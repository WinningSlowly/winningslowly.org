### Show Notes

Chris and Stephen use Chris's first two ridesharing experiences as a jumping-off
point to discuss services like Uber and Lyft from a host of angles: ethical,
financial, technological, social, legal, and personal. Put on your seatbelts,
folks: this one's a long one.

*Note:* Chris told the drivers of his Lyft and Uber rides that he was going to
talk about his experience on this podcast, and they agreed to talk with him.
