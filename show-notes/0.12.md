### Show Notes

In which we talk about headline-writing in general, click-bait headlines in
particular, and why we don't think that click-bait headlines are a "best
practice"---or really a good thing at all. How these realities shape all sorts
of discourse, not just headline-writing, including political stances.

Note: Chris kept talking about Slate when he meant *not* Slate (and specifically
"Pajiba.com"). *His bad.*
