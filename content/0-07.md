### Show Notes

In which we talk about the Affordable Care Act and how implementation---both at a technological level and at a general political level---public perception, and policy combine in strange and surprising ways.

- Technology Failure (2:45--8:36): on how the initial failure of [HealthCare.gov][hc.g] shaped public perception of the ACA.
