### Show Notes

In which we discuss news app Circa, the value it provides in the rapidly
evolving world of new journalism, and why we're super sad about it. (Hint: it's
a Silicon Valley startup and you know what that means about its business model.
Namely: as near as we can tell, they don't have one.)
