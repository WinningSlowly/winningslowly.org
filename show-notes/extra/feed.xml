<h3 id="show-notes">Show Notes</h3>
<p>We talk <em>libraries</em>. Why? Because public libraries are <em>awesome</em>. They’re on of the few unalloyed successes in social experiments.

Show Notes

We talk *libraries*. Why? Because public libraries are *awesome*. They're on of the few unalloyed successes in social experiments. They do good in a wide array of areas, and they're free to use (because we support them as taxpayers). If you want to hear Chris giddy, this is the episode.

The second of two episodes recorded live at NC State University on September 22, 2016. (Yep, our schedule is *way* different this year. You can thank Stephen's Ph.D. thesis and the combination of Chris' M. Div., work, and travel for that!)

Music

* “Widows and Revolutionaries” by Darling Valley. Used by permission.

* “Winning Slowly Theme” by Chris Krycho. Who is also deeply inspired by Tolkien, for the record.

We take on civil forfeiture. The short version: we <em>hate</em> it. It’s a wicked injustice and we think it ought to be fought, and fought hard. (If you want to hear Chris and Stephen get actually angry about something, this is the episode.)

<h3 id="show-notes">Show Notes</h3>
<p>We talk about orchestras, ask whether financial viability is a guide to the health or importance of particular institutions (hint: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines">Betteridge’s Law</a>), and look at how orchestras and other such institutions can be real markers of cultural health even for the people they don’t directly affect.</p>

Flanagan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The permanent orchestra season has, as usual, been financially a bad one all over the country. With the end of April… come the bills for those who pay the piper…. There is always a deficit, which public-spirited guarantors are called upon to pay year after year. A permanent orchestra, it seems pretty welle stablished by American experience, is not at present a paying institution, and is not likely immediately to become so…. [Neverthless,] the prevailing note of the guarantors of the America Orchestras is one of hopefulness. Things are coming on; the public is being educated; it will support the orchestras in larger and larger numbers till they are finally… self-supporting.</p>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Positive / Visible / Social (Organized): orchestras and the question of “public goods”


Show notes

We talk about orchestras, ask whether financial viability is a guide to the health or importance of particular institutions (hint: Betteridge’s Law), and look at how orchestras and other such institutions can be real markers of cultural health even for the people they don’t directly affect.

-   An article in _The New York Times_, in 1903, referenced in _The Perilous Life of Symphony Orchestras_, by Robert J. Flanagan:

    > The permanent orchestra season has, as usual, been financially a bad one all over the country. With the end of April… come the bills for those who pay the piper…. There is always a deficit, which public-spirited guarantors are called upon to pay year after year. A permanent orchestra, it seems pretty welle stablished by American experience, is not at present a paying institution, and is not likely immediately to become so…. [Neverthless,] the prevailing note of the guarantors of the America Orchestras is one of hopefulness. Things are coming on; the public is being educated; it will support the orchestras in larger and larger numbers till they are finally… self-supporting.

-   Stephen’s top three Dutch minimalist recommendations:
    -   “Canto Ostinato” by Simeon Ten Holt
    -   Joep Franssens, whose best known work is “Music of the Spheres”
    -   Jeroen van Veen
-   Prog rock Chris likes:
    -   Explosions in the Sky
    -   Faunts (and especially their album M4)
-   Other music mentioned on the show:
    -   Bach’s Mass in B Minor
    -   Lecrae
    -   Mahler Symphony No. 2 “Resurrection”
    -   Blue Man Group
    -   Spoken word
-   A few of Chris’ composed works: soundcloud.com/chriskrycho


Music

-   “Generation Love” by Jon Reynolds – used by permission.
-   “Winning Slowly Theme” by Chris Krycho. Composed along with hours of other music over the course of his teenage years and adult life. Maybe he’ll make a second career out of that.

<h3>Show Notes</h3>
<p>We introduce our system for thinking about the "structure/agency" or "systems and individuals" problem: how do the systems and structures of our lives shape us? How do we shape <em>them</em>? How free are we, and where are the places where more freedom is good, and the places where it might actually be bad? How do we confront the structural issues we face, or strengthen and preserve the good systems we do have in place?</p>
<h4>Questions we'll be asking</h4>
<ul>
<li>How much can a system penalize an individual for not being part of it?</li>
<li>How much can a system hurt an individual who is part of it?</li>
<li>How much can a system benefit an individual that is part of it?</li>
<li>How much can a system benefit an individual who is not part of it?</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Visible</strong> <em>vs.</em> <strong>Invisible</strong>: is the structural pressure visible or invisible---i.e., living in a capitalist society is <em>invisible</em> but deeply impacts us.</li>

<p>We think that in almost no cases is a radical end of individual freedom <em>or</em> structural control right. Nor does any system have merely positive or negative outcomes; we live in a broken world where even the best systems working in the most productive cycles with the most virtuous individuals still cannot solve everything perfectly. (And, since people's own situations and religious and ethical beliefs differe, there will be people who dispute our positive/negative valence. We make no apologies for ours, but we welcome disagreement!)</p>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Structures and systems, agency and individuals: three axes (and a sub-axis) for thinking about the world we live in.


Show Notes

We introduce our system for thinking about the "structure/agency" or "systems and individuals" problem: how do the systems and structures of our lives shape us? How do we shape them? How free are we, and where are the places where more freedom is good, and the places where it might actually be bad? How do we confront the structural issues we face, or strengthen and preserve the good systems we do have in place?


Questions we'll be asking

• How much can a system penalize an individual for not being part of it?

• How much can a system hurt an individual who is part of it?

• How much can a system benefit an individual that is part of it?

• How much can a system benefit an individual who is not part of it?


Our analytical axes

• Positive vs. Negative: is the relationship between systems and individuals good or bad—and if so, for society as a whole, for individuals, or both?

• Visible vs. Invisible: is the structural pressure visible or invisible—i.e., living in a capitalist society is invisible but deeply impacts us.

• Legal vs. Social: does the structure get its force through law and the power of the government, or through cultural and societal pressure?

    ◦ Organized vs. Unorganized: both social movements and legal structures may be more or less coherent and organized.



Applying the axes

Two big questions we'll ask about the particulars for each issue we look at:

• How constrained are you by these structural pressures?
• To what extent is that constraint or freedom good or problematic?

We think that in almost no cases is a radical end of individual freedom or structural control right. Nor does any system have merely positive or negative outcomes; we live in a broken world where even the best systems working in the most productive cycles with the most virtuous individuals still cannot solve everything perfectly. (And, since people's own situations and religious and ethical beliefs differ, there will be people who dispute our positive/negative valence. We make no apologies for ours, but we welcome disagreement!)

Show Notes

Show Notes

We talk about nation-states, war, hopes of permanent peace and how “the end of history” and the notion of fewer major wars is likely a pipe dream. But also, how to think about foreign policy issues as citizens of nations we love, and the value of nation-states even in a “global village.”

            <description><![CDATA[We pick up from our discussion of Facebook and Internet.org last week to look at the broader questions we raised then: how do you help people <em>well</em>? It’s not enough to have good intentions—so how do you pick good charities to give to? How do you choose where to dedicate your own time and money? How should we think about foreign aid, and foreign intervention, and foreign policy in general?

            <description><![CDATA[We open our fourth season with a discussion of Facebook’s <a href="https://info.internet.org/en/">Internet.org</a> platform, open access vs. power plays by large companies, and the ethical questions at the intersection of business and philanthropy. Chris and Stephen disagree about how to read Facebook’s move, and set the stage for a season-long discussion of globalization and its ramifications for technology, religion, ethics, and art.
<br />Just some light discussion to start things off, in other words.

<blockquote>
<p>The real workplace scandal at Amazon — and in the economy writ large — isn’t the treatment of white-collar workers with plenty of options. It’s the treatment of blue-collar workers with none.</p>
<p>Most of Amazon’s workers, after all, aren’t highly paid engineers or marketers sitting in a Seattle office. They’re contract warehouse workers rushing frantically to meet their packing quotas.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We geek, we gush, and we even manage to say a few serious things about the future of humanity while talking about New Horizons, Rosetta, science fiction, nation-state rivalries, and how we would <em>love</em> to go visit other places in the solar system (or galaxy).</p>
<p><strong>Errata:</strong> Chris said New Frontiers was an ESA probe; it was in fact a NASA probe. He was thinking of <a href="http://rosetta.esa.int">Rosetta</a>, an <a href="http://www.esa.int/ESA" title="European Space Agency">ESA</a> project to land on a comet—which they did, after <a href="http://www.esa.int/esatv/Videos/2013/12/Rosetta_s_Journey_B-Roll/Solar_system_animation_showing_Rosetta_trajectory">the greatest gravity boost sequence in history</a>:</p>

<p class="caption">Slingshot this!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> yep, those are children fussing in the background at one point in the show. Chris has a 3-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old daughter, and the 1-year-old happened to lose her mind mid-recording.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Blogging is not what it was in 2008. It has changed in some ways for the better, in some ways for the worse, and in a few ways that it’s hard to tell. Picking up from an Iranian blogger, Hossein Derakhshan, who was jailed for his political views in 2008, we take a look at hyperlinking, the stream, and personal agency. How can we keep the good of the blog world of 2008 <em>and</em> the good of the stream?</p>

            <itunes:subtitle>Two non-beta seasons down. Metapodcasting is in.</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Show Notes

Chris and Stephen reflect on Season 2: what did we talk about, what have we learned, why do we take breaks, and what changes can you expect for Season 3? For that matter, when is Season 3 coming? And what in the world is the difference between a “series” and a “season” anyway?

            <description><![CDATA[<h3 id="show-notes">Show Notes</h3>
<p>Chris and Stephen take three recent articles about the super-structure of how our society pays for college and scrutinize the issue. How does American society value what college delivers? (What does it deliver?) How do we fund it? Should we fund it? We take the time not just to ponder, but to celebrate an unlikely organization that’s doing some incredibly innovative moves in the space. Also Stephen inadvertently insults a whole group of people. Sorry about that.</p>

<p>Chris and Stephen note the launch of Tidal with some skepticism, then contrast the service with what could be considered Tidal&#8217;s polar opposite: YouTube. We look at the international aspects of music distribution, and think about how youth factor in to the ever-changing equation. And, good news, there&#8217;s a happy ending. I love happy endings. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h3 id="show-notes">Show Notes</h3>
Chris and Stephen use the news of communications tool Slack’s recent hacking incident to discuss the nature of digital security. Along the way we make a plea for candy, claim that almost all companies are digital companies now, offer some security tips to our listeners, and deliver a long bloopers reel. We hope we induce just enough paranoia to get things moving in your security life, but not too much.

            <description><![CDATA[<h3 id="shownotes">Show Notes</h3>
Chris and Stephen discuss the ethics of individual health, a complex and idiosyncratic problem if there ever was one. How do we be responsible stewards of our bodies? How do we think about activities and intakes in moral, ethical, deeply personal ways? We suggest thinking about personal health in community, as well as from a spiritual perspective.

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Chris and Stephen discuss the ethics of individual health, a complex and idiosyncratic problem if there ever was one. How do we be responsible stewards of our bodies? How do we think about activities and intakes in moral, ethical, deeply personal ways? We suggest thinking about personal health in community, as well as from a spiritual perspective.

            <description><![CDATA[<h3 id="shownotes">Show Notes</h3>Chris and Stephen “review” Rich Mullins’ 1993 album <em>A Liturgy, a Legacy, and a Ragamuffin Band</em> because it’s beautiful, thoughtful, and still relevant today. The music is still passionate, raw, and wild; the lyrics are still pensive, powerful, and awe-struck. We look at how Mullins wrote the album as a letter to Christians about how to be alive in the hope of Christ and reality of America. Also, there’s hammered dulcimer.

<p>In which we ask: What exactly <em>is</em> art? Specifically, is photography art? But more generally, can anyone actually define art? How does the difficulty in defining art affect the makers of art, and why do people spend so much time trying to draw lines around it? How have democratizing forces changed the nature of art in the last few decades, and what does that bode for our future?</p>

<h3>Before You Go</h3>
<p>N.B. In addition to the clarifications Stephen offered, we should note that Chris’ initial description overstated the case a bit. The law did not technically <em>forbid</em> classes from teaching AP US History. It just, you know… promised to <em>defund</em> the teaching thereof.</p>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In which we ask: What exactly is art? Specifically, is photography art? But more generally, can anyone actually define art? How does the difficulty in defining art affect the makers of art, and why do people spend so much time trying to draw lines around it? How have democratizing forces changed the nature of art in the last few decades, and what does that bode for our future?

Before You Go

N.B. In addition to the clarifications Stephen offered, we should note that Chris' initial description overstated the case a bit. The law did not technically forbid classes from teaching AP US History. It just, you know... promised to defund the teaching thereof.

<p>In which we look at Zoë Keating’s ongoing kerfuffle with YouTube. Is YouTube strong-arming indie artists? Should megacorporations force all their clients—customer and producer—to fit in a one-size-fits-all setup, or should they take the long view and do what is best not only for the bottom line but also for the relationship between artist and audience. Oh, and what about those monopolies and monopsonies? They might have some extra ethical responsibility, too!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your social network is owned by advertisers.</p>

<p>Every post you share, every friend you make, and every link you follow is tracked, recorded, and converted into data. Advertisers buy your data so they can show you more ads. You are the product that’s bought and sold.
<br />We believe there is a better way. We believe in audacity. We believe in beauty, simplicity, and transparency. We believe that the people who make things and the people who use them should be in partnership.</p>

<p>We believe a social network can be a tool for empowerment. Not a tool to deceive, coerce, and manipulate &#8211; but a place to connect, create, and celebrate life.</p>

<p>You are not a product.</p>

We talk about what individuals’ relationship with technology should look like, how we should view those who behave wickedly, and where there might be hope for solving these kinds of problems in our society.

In which we talk about the drive to publish all the time and the value of publishing more substantive content at a slower pace. We talk about the way the internet has driven us toward rapid-fire publishing models and how long-form and high-quality content is difficult (if not impossible) to publish on this model. We look at how to build an audience via quality and the slow route instead of the click-driven model, note that this is difficult to sustain as a means of income, and even think a bit about the history of long-form and serial publishing.

Springboarding from public/internet reactions to Christian musician Michael Gungor’s discussion of his views on Genesis, we talk about the necessity of charity, Chris’ Rules for Argument, the importance of taking a long-term view on friendship and persuasion, and what to do in the face of serious disagreement about important issues.

In which we talk about The Collection's new album, Ars Moriendi (“The Art of Dying”). We cover the musicality of the album itself, then dive into the way it wrestles with hard topics in a faithfully Christian way without either succumbing to despair or giving into the lure of trite and reductionistic answers. We talk about what good art is and does and how utilitarianism is a fundamental misstep in the making of good art, and we note that culture at large and evangelical subculture could do with a great deal more of this sort of thoughtful reflection on death.

In which we look (rather critically) at the tech sphere’s tendency to assume everything not only can but should be disrupted. Snarky asides on smartwatches and smartshoes segue into a discussion of the necessity of humility and the importance of recognizing what technology *cannot* do and what it *should* not do.

Note: by “disruption” we are focused not on the particular concept developed by Clay Christensen, but on the popular view of the word. We are aware of the distinction, but decided to set it aside for the purposes of this particular episode.

In which we talk about how watching companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook try to “pivot”—that is, attempting (and usually failing) to do something outside their core areas of competency—highlights the difficulty of institutional change in general. We apply this idea to everything from the strengths and weaknesses of different Christian denominations to the way structural change occurs in the government.

A few explanatory comments:

• Yes, we’re fully aware that the PCA (to which Stephen belongs) has *lots* of missionaries on the field, and that Southern Baptists’ (of which Chris is one) views on alcohol are a great deal more complicated than just generic grumpiness. But those details are less important to the particular discussion we were having today.

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[# Show Notes

In which we tackle copyright (or left, as you like), barely touch on patents, and generally try to think about how to handle questions of intellectual property as consumers and creators thereof in the brave new world of digital economics and cheap copies of everything (even Nike shoes).

## Chapters

• Intro (1:02)
• The Reason for Copyright (1:02–8:22)
• Valuing Products in Different Ways (8:22–19:55)
• "Pay Me For This Thing" (19:55–26:55)
• Conclusion (28:10)

# Music

We know. Pretty sweet sounds. Even if we do say so ourselves.

• “New Life” (http://themidnightsons.bandcamp.com), from the album New Life, by Stephen Carradini. Used because we can do whatever we want with our own music! (Turns out, in this case, so can you…)
• “Winning Slowly Theme” (https://soundcloud.com/chriskrycho/winning-slowly), by Chris Krycho. See above!

<h4>Chapters</h4>

<ul>
<li><em>God’s Not Dead</em> (2:56–10:09) – propositions in movie format, a.k.a. a tract.</li>

<li><em>Son of God</em> (10:09–18:45) – moving higher on the art scale, and not trying to be big (in contrast with e.g. <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>).</li>

<li><em>Noah</em> (18:45–26:06) – all art, not so much on the textual fidelity. We might be okay with that.</li>

<li>“Heaven Thrown In” (26:06–31:04) – on how aiming to start a conversation sometimes has the opposite effect, and how making good art sometimes produces a great conversation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside: Stephen made a tent to record in his hotel room in Indianapolis (<a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/images/podcast-ghost.jpg">visual proof here</a>). Some scratchy audio from the blanket ensued, but so did clean audio for his voice. See what we do for you listeners?</p>

<p>In which we talk about what happens when people yell at each other about what they should and shouldn&#8217;t be writing, how musicians&#8217; attitudes toward &#8220;making a career of it&#8221; seem to have shifted in the last few decades, and why not having a business plan is a bad plan.</p>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[# Show Notes

In which we talk about what happens when people yell at each other about what they should and shouldn't be writing, how musicians' attitudes toward "making a career of it" seem to have shifted in the last few decades, and why not having a business plan is a bad plan.

## Chapters

- Beating Up Writers (1:57--17:35): everyone from tech startups to Nicholas Kristof has an opinion about what you should be writing---and so do we... sort of.
- Musical Careering (17:35--28:50): an interview with Future Islands prompts some reflection on what exactly a "career" in the music world is.
- Losing Editorially (28:50--41:55): no business plan means you might not stick around as a company---and that makes us sad.

# Music

- Opening music: ["Know How To Live"](http://papercitymusic.bandcamp.com/track/know-how-to-live) by Paper City
- Closing music: [Winning Slowly Theme](https://soundcloud.com/chriskrycho/winning-slowly) by Chris Krycho. Used by dint of being written for the show.
