### Show Notes

In which we start with a look at some really neat apps designed to ease political engagement in the United States and then branch out to talk about the limits of political engagement, the importance of valuing other forms of public life, and what it means to be fully-realized human beings.

#### Corrigenda

Chris said that Countable addresses local politics; it does not. It focuses on national bills in the House and Senate. Also, he mentioned the Westminster Confession but meant the Westminster Shorter Catechism.
