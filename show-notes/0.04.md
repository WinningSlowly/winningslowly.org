### Show Notes

In which we talk about what happens when people yell at each other about what
they should and shouldn't be writing, how musicians' attitudes toward "making a
career of it" seem to have shifted in the last few decades, and why not having a
business plan is a bad plan.

#### Chapters

  - Beating Up Writers (1:57--17:35): everyone from tech startups to Nicholas
    Kristof has an opinion about what you should be writing---and so do we...
    sort of.
  - Musical Careering (17:35--28:50): an interview with Future Islands prompts
    some reflection on what exactly a "career" in the music world is.
  - Losing Editorially (28:50--41:55): no business plan means you might not
    stick around as a company---and that makes us sad.
