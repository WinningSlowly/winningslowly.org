### Show Notes

In which we talk about the recent celebrity nude selfies leak from just about
every angle: the people who hijacked the photos, those who took the photos, the
technology used to store the photos, and society at large. We talk about what
individuals' relationship with technology should look like, how we should view
those who behave wickedly, and where there might be hope for solving these kinds
of problems in our society.
