### Show Notes

In which we talk about how greedy pricing schemes an and will run you right out
of business (by running you right out of customers), how the Ken Ham-Bill Nye
debate raises questions about Christians in the public square, and how
incredibly weird it is that we can (and do) lose parts of the internet.
