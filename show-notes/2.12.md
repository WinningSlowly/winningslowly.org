### Show Notes

Chris and Stephen give three cheers for Dan Price, who voluntarily cut his own pay and raised the pay of his employees to a minimum of $70K a year. We discuss the nature of money, income inequality, how we can fix problems in non-governmental ways (sometimes, and in some ways), and about the limits of praise. We also inaugurate Mr. Price into the newly-founded Winning Slowly Hall of Fame amidst celebratory explosions. (No, really.)
