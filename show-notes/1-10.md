### Show Notes

In which we talk about something Apple did this week... but not the thing they announced, and almost certainly not what you'd expect. Namely: the death of the iPod Classic: Apple's oldest consumer product outside the Mac, and a veritable gamechanger for the music industry. It's gone, and Stephen is upset. (Chris, not so much.)
