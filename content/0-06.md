### Show Notes

In which we talk at length about art and the arts in the context of Christianity, taking the three religiously themed movies in theaters right now as our jumping off point.

#### Chapters

- _God's Not Dead_ (2:56--10:09) -- propositions in movie format, a.k.a. a tract.
- _Son of God_ (10:09--18:45) -- moving higher on the art scale, and not trying to be big (in contrast with e.g. _The Passion of the Christ_).
- _Noah_ (18:45--26:06) -- all art, not so much on the textual fidelity. We might be okay with that.
- "Heaven Thrown In" (26:06--31:04) -- on how aiming to start a conversation sometimes has the opposite effect, and how making good art sometimes produces a great conversation.
