### Show Notes

In which we talk about how greedy pricing schemes can and will run you right out
of business (by running you right out of customers), how the Ken Ham-Bill Nye
debate raises questions about Christians in the public square, and how
incredibly weird it is that we can (and do) lose parts of the internet.

- Insane pricing schemes: Network Solutions ripping off its customers (1:07--13:05)
- Ken Ham vs. Bill Nye, the "culture war", and having the wisdom to decide when
  one ought to opt for political silence and when one ought to opt for
  engagement (13:06--28:53)
- Link rot, backups, and losing parts of the internet (28:54--41:51)

### Music

- Opening music: ["The South"][1] by The Duke of Norfolk
