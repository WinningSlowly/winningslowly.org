Summary: >
    We point out several concerns that we have with the arguments Dr. Franklin makes in her lectures-turned-book: the ineffectiveness of her holistic and prescriptive technologies frame, her deeply cynical view on policy, and other thorny places that her arguments lead (like the Soviet Union).

### Show Notes

* [Cold War peace movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_movement#Anti-nuclear_movement)
* [Peace movements in Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_movement#Canada)
* [Second-wave feminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism) (to which Dr. Franklin's feminism approximately belongs to)\
* [History of environmental movements, post-WWII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism#Post-war_expansion)
* [Bijker, Hughes & Pinch's seminal work on Social Construction of Technology](https://www.alibris.com/The-Social-Construction-of-Technological-Systems-Anniversary-Edition-New-Directions-in-the-Sociology-and-History-of-Technology/book/47838926?matches=9): Stephen left out Hughes. Sorry, Thomas P. Hughes.
* [Actor-Network Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory)
* John Law and Annemarie Mol's [Handpump article](https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/situating-technoscience-an-inquiry-into-spatialities): Stephen incorrectly only mentioned Mol instead of Law and Mol. Sorry, John Law. 
* [Robert Moses's bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses#Racism) 
* [Bay of Pigs invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion), also sometimes known as the Bay of Pigs incident: Stephen's point in bringing this up was to allude to the point made neatly in the Wikipedia article: "[The failed invasion] also pushed Cuba closer to the Soviet Union, and those strengthened Soviet-Cuban relations would lead to the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962."
* [Almost no nuclear power plants have been built since 1990](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=30972)
* [Nuclear power plants historically have decreased carbon emissions significantly](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-nuclear-power-can-stop-global-warming/): see paragraph four


Here's the great cover of the book from the '80s--note that at no time are floppy disks mentioned in the book.
