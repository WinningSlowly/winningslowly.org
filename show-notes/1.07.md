### Show Notes

In which we talk about Taylor Swift, Twitter, and changes in expectations. We
admit that Chris is a Taylor Swift fan and that Stephen is a hipster. Then we
get down to the business of talking about how these two changes differ both in
messaging and in content, and look at the ways that both consumers and producers
have to be intentional in managing expectations.
