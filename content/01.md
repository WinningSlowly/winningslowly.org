### Show notes

In which we talk about how context shapes (or *should* shape) our decisions
regarding technology, with three big topics:

- Christian author and former pastor [John Piper][jp] and [Pope Francis][pope]
  on Twitter
- Google acquiring Nest and the ensuing internet freakout
- Intentionally unprofitable bands and the changing shape of music industry, as
  highlighted by miniature label [Controlled Burn Records][cbr] and band
  [Nonagon][nonagon]

### Links

Sometimes we mention things in our show. When we do, we link them here. Makes it
easier for you that way... gives you some *context*, as it were.
