### Show Notes

In which we talk about Marco Arment, Kirby Delauter, and the general phenomenon of things you say on the internet going viral (often when you least expect them to). How do you deal with the reality that your audience is *never* limited but may universalize at any moment? What is the audience's responsibility, and what are creators' responsibilities? How do we deal charitably with authors writing "in-house" on controversial topics?

P.S. You're going to want to listen to the bloopers on this one, all the way through to the end. Trust us.
