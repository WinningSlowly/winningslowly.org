### Show Notes

In which we take seventeen minutes (on the dot!) to have a really great time
explaining why there was no Episode 0.08. Basically: because it ended up being
terrible by dint of having completely gotten away from us. The net result: a
lesson in the difference between blogging and podcasting, a bit more humility,
and a lot of laughter at our own expense.
