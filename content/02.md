### Show Notes

In which we talk about doing "content" right---whether that content is streaming
radio, books published by Christian pastors, or massive trade laws.

- Spotify, Pandora, and iTunes Radio: thinking about the ups and downs of each
  service
- Pastor-authors: thinking about "plagiarism" and whose names end up on books
- The Trans-Pacific Partnership: or, how making laws in secret as fast as
  possible is bad for democracy
