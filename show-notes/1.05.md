***Warning:*** this episode touches on some *very* difficult topics, including both death in general and suicide in particular. If these are especially sensitive topics for you, we recommend you skip this episode. Maybe go back and listen to [_Superhero Movies!_][1] instead.

### Show Notes

In which we talk about The Collection's new album, _Ars Moriendi_ ("The Art of Dying"). We cover the musicality of the album itself, then dive into the way it wrestles with hard topics in a faithfully Christian way without either succumbing to despair or giving into the lure of trite and reductionistic answers. We talk about what good art is and does and how utilitarianism is a fundamental misstep in the making of good art, and we note that culture at large and evangelical subculture could do with a great deal more of this sort of thoughtful reflection on death.
