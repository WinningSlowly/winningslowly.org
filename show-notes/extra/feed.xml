        <description>A forum for two interdisciplinary thinkers to discuss the long view of current trends in technology, religion, art, ethics, and culture. There are plenty of podcasts that will tell you how Apple’s latest product will affect the tech landscape tomorrow, but there aren’t that many concerned with the potential impact of that tech in 2024. In a culture obsessed with now, how can we make choices with a view for tomorrow, next year, and beyond?</description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h3>Show Notes</h3>

<p>In which we talk about Marco Arment, Kirby Delauter, and the general phenomenon of things you say on the internet going viral (often when you least expect them to). How do you deal with the reality that your audience is <em>never</em> limited but may universalize at any moment? What is the audience&#8217;s responsibility, and what are creators&#8217; responsibilities? How do we deal charitably with authors writing &#8220;in-house&#8221; on controversial topics?</p>

<p>P.S. You&#8217;re going to want to listen to the bloopers on this one, all the way through to the end. Trust us.</p>

In which we talk about Marco Arment, Kirby Delauter, and the general phenomenon of things you say on the internet going viral (often when you least expect them to).

How do we deal charitably with authors writing “in-house” on controversial topics?

<p>In which we talk about science journalism&#8212;the ways in which it is sometimes broken, the reasons why it ends up broken in those cases, and the responsibilities of scientists, scientific journalists, and the science-reading public in publishing and interpreting scientific findings.

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Show Notes

In which we talk about science journalism—the ways in which it is sometimes broken, the reasons why it ends up broken in those cases, and the responsibilities of scientists, scientific journalists, and the science-reading public in publishing and interpreting scientific findings. Science is hard. Reporting on it is hard. Making policy on it is hard. And we need all of them.

Chapters

◦ Intro (1:27)
◦ SCIENCE Drives Policy! (1:27–8:02)
◦ Elitist, Protectionist, Obstructionist, Obscurantist? (8:02–17:14)
◦ Pressures and Responsibilities All Around (17:14–24:10)
◦ Conclusion (24:10–25:12)
◦ Funny Things We Cut (25:12–25:22)

Music

◦ “Where I Go” (https://soundcloud.com/pistol-shrimp/where-i-go/s-56M1k), by Pistol Shrimp (http://www.officialpistolshrimp.com). Used by permission.
◦ “Winning Slowly Theme” (https://soundcloud.com/chriskrycho/winning-slowly) by Chris Krycho. Who still gets it stuck in his head every time he edits the show.

<blockquote>
<p>Your social network is owned by advertisers.</p>

<p>Every post you share, every friend you make, and every link you follow is tracked, recorded, and converted into data. Advertisers buy your data so they can show you more ads. You are the product that’s bought and sold.
<br />We believe there is a better way. We believe in audacity. We believe in beauty, simplicity, and transparency. We believe that the people who make things and the people who use them should be in partnership.</p>

<p>We believe a social network can be a tool for empowerment. Not a tool to deceive, coerce, and manipulate &#8211; but a place to connect, create, and celebrate life.</p>

<p>You are not a product.</p>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Show Notes

In which we geek out about Doctor Who... and do our best to say something meaningful about the necessity of people who can tell us what we're getting wrong in life, and who can be strong where we have weaknesses.

Correction

We said only one episode of new Doctor Who has won a Hugo. We were dreadfully wrong: the show has won six Hugos since the revival in 2006.

Whoops.

Recommended Moffat Episodes of Doctor Who

◦ “The Empty Child” and “The Doctor Dances”
◦ “The Girl in the Fireplace”
◦ “Blink”
◦ “Silence in the Library” and “Forest of the Dead”
◦ “The Day of the Doctor” (fiftieth anniversary special)


Chapters

◦ Intro (1:10)
◦ I Am Awesome At This (1:10–7:03)
◦ Actually It Was a Robot in a Dream (7:03–14:48)
◦ Lone Rebel Genius (14:48–20:38)
◦ Hip Motion is for Losers (20:38–25:04)
◦ Conclusion (25:04–26:30)
◦ Things We Cut. Yep. (26:30–27:08)

Music

◦ “Doctor Who Theme” (https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/doctor-who-theme-tv-version/id211202668?i=211202676), by Ron Grainer, arranged by Murray Gold. We're pretty confident this goes under Fair Use.
◦ “Winning Slowly Theme” (https://soundcloud.com/chriskrycho/winning-slowly) by Chris Krycho. No dance beat today, sorry.

In which we talk about the recent celebrity nude selfies leak from just about every angle: the people who hijacked the photos, those who took the photos, the technology used to store the photos, and society at large. We talk about what individuals’ relationship with technology should look like, how we should view those who behave wickedly, and where there might be hope for solving these kinds of problems in our society.

In which we talk about the drive to publish all the time and the value of publishing more substantive content at a slower pace. We talk about the way the internet has driven us toward rapid-fire publishing models and how long-form and high-quality content is difficult (if not impossible) to publish on this model. We look at how to build an audience via quality and the slow route instead of the click-driven model, note that this is difficult to sustain as a means of income, and even think a bit about the history of long-form and serial publishing.

<p>In which we talk about superhero movies as context for dealing well and poorly with success and failure. And geek out about superhero movies. (Honestly, we mostly just geek out about superhero movies.) But along the way, we do note that DC, Marvel, Sony, and Fox have dealt with their successes and failures in some radically different ways, and note some ways in which we might all learn from our superhero friends.</p>
<p>Also, we unabashedly make mistakes ourselves, own them, and laugh at them. One of them might even be after the theme music at the end.</p>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[# Show Notes

In which we talk about superhero movies as context for dealing well and poorly with success and failure. And geek out about superhero movies. (Honestly, we mostly just geek out about superhero movies.) But along the way, we do note that DC, Marvel, Sony, and Fox have dealt with their successes and failures in some radically different ways, and note some ways in which we might all learn from our superhero friends.

Also, we unabashedly make mistakes ourselves, own them, and laugh at them. One of them might even be after the theme music at the end.

## Chapters

◦ Intro (1:23)
◦ Marvel/DC/Sony/Fox (1:23–5:22)
◦ Reboots (5:22–8:53)
◦ Copying the Other Guy (8:53–15:34)
◦ Not Learning From Failure (15:34–19:25)
◦ The Gold Standard (19:25–28:12)
◦ Conclusion (28:12–29:28)
◦ “You Just Forgot to Do the Other Half of That” (29:28–29:39)

# Music

            <description><![CDATA[<h3>Show Notes</h3>

<p>In which we look (rather critically) at the tech sphere&#8217;s tendency to assume everything not only can but should be disrupted. Snarky asides on smartwatches and smartshoes segue into a discussion of the necessity of humility and the importance of recognizing what technology <em>cannot</em> do and what it <em>should</em> not do.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> by &#8220;disruption&#8221; we are focused not on the particular concept developed by Clay Christensen, but on the popular view of the word. We are aware of the distinction, but decided to set it aside for the purposes of this particular episode.</p>

Snarky asides on smartwatches and smartshoes segue into a discussion of the necessity of humility and the importance of recognizing what technology *cannot* do and what it *should* not do.

Note: by “disruption” we are focused not on the particular concept developed by Clay Christensen, but on the popular view of the word. We are aware of the distinction, but decided to set it aside for the purposes of this particular episode.

In which we talk about one of the <em>longest</em> views: family. In particular, we look at the ways that all our pursuits—especially those having to do with family—force us to make choices about what we value most and to allocate our time accordingly. After all, one’s impact on one’s family is far more long-lasting than nearly anything else we do. We also spend some time thinking about the responsibilities of corporations to develop expectations that support families as genuinely valuable to culture

In which we talk about how watching companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook try to “pivot”—that is, attempting (and usually failing) to do something outside their core areas of competency—highlights the difficulty of institutional change in general. We apply this idea to everything from the strengths and weaknesses of different Christian denominations to the way structural change occurs in the government.

A few explanatory comments:

• Yes, we’re fully aware that the PCA (to which Stephen belongs) has *lots* of missionaries on the field, and that Southern Baptists’ (of which Chris is one) views on alcohol are a great deal more complicated than just generic grumpiness. But those details are less important to the particular discussion we were having today.

## Chapters

• Intro (1:32)
• Tech Companies (1:32–8:16)
• Denominations Don't Change Fast Either (8:16–14:26)
• Dealing in Institutional Realities (14:26–23:06)

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[# Show Notes

• Follow-up: Fixed and Marginal Costs (0:53–1:44)

How these realities shape all sorts of discourse, not just headline-writing, including political stances.</p>

<p>Note: Chris kept talking about Slate when he meant <em>not</em> Slate (and specifically &#8220;Pajiba.com&#8221;). <em>His bad.</em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h3>Show Notes</h3>

<p>In which we talk at length about art and the arts in the context of Christianity, taking the three religiously themed movies in theaters right now as our jumping off point.</p>

<h4>Chapters</h4>

<ul>
<li><em>God’s Not Dead</em> (2:56–10:09) – propositions in movie format, a.k.a. a tract.</li>

<li><em>Son of God</em> (10:09–18:45) – moving higher on the art scale, and not trying to be big (in contrast with e.g. <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>).</li>

<li><em>Noah</em> (18:45–26:06) – all art, not so much on the textual fidelity. We might be okay with that.</li>

<li>“Heaven Thrown In” (26:06–31:04) – on how aiming to start a conversation sometimes has the opposite effect, and how making good art sometimes produces a great conversation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside: Stephen made a tent to record in his hotel room in Indianapolis (<a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/images/podcast-ghost.jpg">visual proof here</a>). Some scratchy audio from the blanket ensued, but so did clean audio for his voice. See what we do for you listeners?</p>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[# Show Notes

In which we talk at length about art and the arts in the context of Christianity, taking the three religiously themed movies in theaters right now as our jumping off point.

## Chapters

* God’s Not Dead (2:56–10:09) – propositions in movie format, a.k.a. a tract.
* Son of God (10:09–18:45) – moving higher on the art scale, and not trying to be big (in contrast with e.g. The Passion of the Christ).
* Noah (18:45–26:06) – all art, not so much on the textual fidelity. We might be okay with that.
* “Heaven Thrown In” (26:06–31:04) – on how aiming to start a conversation sometimes has the opposite effect, and how making good art sometimes produces a great conversation.

Aside: Stephen made a tent to record in his hotel room in Indianapolis. Some scratchy audio from the blanket ensued, but so did clean audio for his voice. See what we do for you listeners? Visual proof here: http://www.winningslowly.org/images/podcast-ghost.jpg
