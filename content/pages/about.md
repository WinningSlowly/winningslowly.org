Summary: Winning Slowly: The long view of tech, religion, art, ethics, and culture.

## What

Winning Slowly is a forum for two interdisciplinary thinkers to discuss the long view of current trends in technology, religion, art, ethics, and culture. There are plenty of podcasts that will tell you how Apple's latest product will affect the tech landscape tomorrow, but there aren't that many concerned with the potential impact of that tech in 2024. In a culture obsessed with *now*, how can we make choices with a view for tomorrow, next year, and beyond?

From crowdsourcing to Twitter gaffes to superhero movies to genetics to social justice issues, Winning Slowly delivers a thoughtful analysis of how the small things we do can have big impacts (and vice versa).

## When
