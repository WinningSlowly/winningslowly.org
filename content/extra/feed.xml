        <title>Winning Slowly</title>
        <link>http://winningslowly.org/</link>
        <description>A forum for two interdisciplinary thinkers to discuss the long view of current trends in technology, religion, art, ethics, and culture. There are plenty of podcasts that will tell you how Apple’s latest product will affect the tech landscape tomorrow, but there aren’t that many concerned with the potential impact of that tech in 2024. In a culture obsessed with now, how can we make choices with a view for tomorrow, next year, and beyond?</description>

<p>In which we take seventeen minutes (on the dot!) to have a really great time explaining why there was no Episode 0.08. Basically: because it ended up being terrible by dint of having completely gotten away from us. The net result: a lesson in the difference between blogging and podcasting, a bit more humility, and a lot of laughter at our own expense.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h3>Show Notes</h3>

<p>In which we talk at length about art and the arts in the context of Christianity, taking the three religiously themed movies in theaters right now as our jumping off point.</p>

<h4>Chapters</h4>

<ul>
<li><em>God’s Not Dead</em> (2:56–10:09) – propositions in movie format, a.k.a. a tract.</li>

<li><em>Son of God</em> (10:09–18:45) – moving higher on the art scale, and not trying to be big (in contrast with e.g. <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>).</li>

<li><em>Noah</em> (18:45–26:06) – all art, not so much on the textual fidelity. We might be okay with that.</li>

<li>“Heaven Thrown In” (26:06–31:04) – on how aiming to start a conversation sometimes has the opposite effect, and how making good art sometimes produces a great conversation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside: Stephen made a tent to record in his hotel room in Indianapolis (<a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/images/podcast-ghost.jpg">visual proof here</a>). Some scratchy audio from the blanket ensued, but so did clean audio for his voice. See what we do for you listeners?</p>

- Musical Careering (17:35--28:50): an interview with Future Islands prompts some reflection on what exactly a "career" in the music world is.
- Losing Editorially (28:50--41:55): no business plan means you might not stick around as a company---and that makes us sad.
