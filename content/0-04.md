### Show Notes

In which we talk about what happens when people yell at each other about what they should and shouldn't be writing, how musicians' attitudes toward "making a career of it" seem to have shifted in the last few decades, and why not having a business plan is a bad plan.

#### Chapters

- Beating Up Writers (1:57--17:35): everyone from tech startups to Nicholas Kristof has an opinion about what you should be writing---and so do we... sort of.
- Musical Careering (17:35--28:50): an interview with Future Islands prompts some reflection on what exactly a "career" in the music world is.
- Losing Editorially (28:50--41:55): no business plan means you might not stick around as a company---and that makes us sad.
