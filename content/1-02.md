### Show Notes

In which we talk about one of the *longest* views: family. In particular, we look at the ways that all our pursuits---especially those having to do with family---force us to make choices about what we value most and to allocate our time accordingly. After all, one's impact on one's family is far more long-lasting than nearly anything else we do. We also spend some time thinking about the responsibilities of corporations to develop expectations that support families as genuinely valuable to culture
