### Show Notes

In which we talk about superhero movies as context for dealing well and poorly with success and failure. And geek out about superhero movies. (Honestly, we mostly just geek out about superhero movies.) But along the way, we do note that DC, Marvel, Sony, and Fox have dealt with their successes and failures in some radically different ways, and note some ways in which we might all learn from our superhero friends.

Also, we unabashedly make mistakes ourselves, own them, and laugh at them. One of them might even be after the theme music at the end.
