### Show Notes

We take on civil forfeiture. The short version: we *hate* it. It's a wicked injustice and we think it ought to be fought, and fought hard. (If you want to hear Chris and Stephen get actually angry about something, this is the episode.) The first of two episodes recorded live at NCSU on September 22, 2016.
