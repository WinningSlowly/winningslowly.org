Summary: Winning Slowly: The long view of tech, religion, art, ethics, and culture.

## What

Winning Slowly is a forum for two interdisciplinary thinkers to discuss the long
view of current trends in technology, religion, art, ethics, and culture. There
are plenty of podcasts that will tell you how Apple's latest product will affect
the tech landscape tomorrow, but there aren't that many concerned with the
potential impact of that tech in 2024. In a culture obsessed with *now*, how can
we make choices with a view for tomorrow, next year, and beyond?

From crowdsourcing to Twitter gaffes to superhero movies to genetics to social
justice issues, Winning Slowly delivers a thoughtful analysis of how the small
things we do can have big impacts (and vice versa).

## When

Winning Slowly episodes (usually) come out every Tuesday at 7 am Eastern time.
If unforeseen scheduling issues arise, we will add a note below accordingly.
Episodes are normally 25--30 minutes long.

We are currently on a hiatus between Seasons 2 and 3. We expect to start up 
again in early July, 2015. In the meantime, please enjoy the archives!

### Season 2

Season 2 began with  [2.01: Take My Money Please!][2.01] on January 27, 2015 and
concluded with [2.15: Metapodcasting][2.15] on May 12, 2015.

### Season 1

Our first "official" season---the one that was *not* a "beta"---started on July
15, 2014, with [1.01: Massive Emotional Contagion][1.01], and wrapped up with
the release of [1.18: Keep On Keepin' On][1.18] on November 18,
2014.

The main hiccup in Season 1? Stephen's audio. It varies like crazy week
to week, for reasons that eluded us. We blame grumpy, grumpy monkeys.

### Season 0

Our first season: "This is a beta; bear with us!"---in which we spent a few
months just figuring out what we were doing, ran from January 28, 2014 until May
20, 2014. Seriously: we had *no idea* what we were doing; we just knew we had a
good idea for a show and wanted to figure out how to make it work. There is good
content here, but we have kept this around mostly for historical interest---it's
*rough*.

Episodes ranged in length from over 45 minutes to under 20 minutes as we figured
out our approach to the show, solicited regular feedback, and general got a
handle on the whole thing. By the final episode, [0.14: Deep In Their Bones], we
had found our basic formula and settled into a nice rhythm, which we were then
able to carry into Season 1.
