        <description>A forum for two interdisciplinary thinkers to discuss the long view of current trends in technology, religion, art, ethics, and culture. There are plenty of podcasts that will tell you how Apple’s latest product will affect the tech landscape tomorrow, but there aren’t that many concerned with the potential impact of that tech in 2024. In a culture obsessed with now, how can we make choices with a view for tomorrow, next year, and beyond?</description>

        <itunes:summary>Winning Slowly is a forum for two interdisciplinary thinkers to discuss the long view of current trends in technology, religion, art, ethics, and culture. There are plenty of podcasts that will tell you how Apple’s latest product will affect the tech landscape tomorrow, but there aren’t that many concerned with the potential impact of that tech in 2024. In a culture obsessed with now, how can we make choices with a view for tomorrow, next year, and beyond? From crowdsourcing to Twitter gaffes to superhero movies to genetics to social justice issues, Winning Slowly delivers a thoughtful analysis of how the small things we do can have big impacts (and vice versa).</itunes:summary>

<p>In which we talk about the recent celebrity nude selfies leak from just about every angle: the people who hijacked the photos, those who took the photos, the technology used to store the photos, and society at large. We talk about what individuals&#8217; relationship with technology should look like, how we should view those who behave wickedly, and where there might be hope for solving these kinds of problems in our society.</p>

<p>In which we talk about the drive to publish all the time and the value of publishing more substantive content at a slower pace. We talk about the way the internet has driven us toward rapid-fire publishing models and how long-form and high-quality content is difficult (if not impossible) to publish on this model. We look at how to build an audience via quality and the slow route instead of the click-driven model, note that this is difficult to sustain as a means of income, and even think a bit about the history of long-form and serial publishing.</p>

In which we talk about Taylor Swift, Twitter, and changes in expectations. We admit that Chris is a Taylor Swift fan and that Stephen is a hipster. Then we get down to the business of talking about how these two changes differ both in messaging and in content, and look at the ways that both consumers and producers have to be intentional in managing expectations.

In which we discuss the necessity of extending charity to each other in our conversations, especially conversations on controversial issues. Springboarding from public/internet reactions to Christian musician Michael Gungor’s discussion of his views on Genesis, we talk about the necessity of charity, Chris’ Rules for Argument, the importance of taking a long-term view on friendship and persuasion, and what to do in the face of serious disagreement about important issues.

            <description><![CDATA[<h3>Show Notes</h3>

<p>In which we look (rather critically) at the tech sphere&#8217;s tendency to assume everything not only can but should be disrupted. Snarky asides on smartwatches and smartshoes segue into a discussion of the necessity of humility and the importance of recognizing what technology <em>cannot</em> do and what it <em>should</em> not do.</p>

In which we look (rather critically) at the tech sphere’s tendency to assume everything not only can but should be disrupted. Snarky asides on smartwatches and smartshoes segue into a discussion of the necessity of humility and the importance of recognizing what technology *cannot* do and what it *should* not do.

Note: by “disruption” we are focused not on the particular concept developed by Clay Christensen, but on the popular view of the word. We are aware of the distinction, but decided to set it aside for the purposes of this particular episode.

In which we talk about one of the <em>longest</em> views: family. In particular, we look at the ways that all our pursuits—especially those having to do with family—force us to make choices about what we value most and to allocate our time accordingly. After all, one’s impact on one’s family is far more long-lasting than nearly anything else we do. We also spend some time thinking about the responsibilities of corporations to develop expectations that support families as genuinely valuable to culture

In which we talk about how watching companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook try to “pivot”—that is, attempting (and usually failing) to do something outside their core areas of competency—highlights the difficulty of institutional change in general. We apply this idea to everything from the strengths and weaknesses of different Christian denominations to the way structural change occurs in the government.

A few explanatory comments:

• Yes, we’re fully aware that the PCA (to which Stephen belongs) has *lots* of missionaries on the field, and that Southern Baptists’ (of which Chris is one) views on alcohol are a great deal more complicated than just generic grumpiness. But those details are less important to the particular discussion we were having today.

            <itunes:subtitle>Headline-Writing, Whether Ends Justify Means, Means Shape Ends, Truthy, or Truly?</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary># Show Notes

In which we talk about headline-writing in general, click-bait headlines in particular, and why we don't think that click-bait headlines are a “best practice”—or really a good thing at all. How these realities shape all sorts of discourse, not just headline-writing, including political stances.

Note: Chris kept talking about Slate when he meant *not* Slate (and specifically "Pajiba.com"). *His bad.*

## Chapters

• Intro (1:26)
• Headline-Writing (1:26–6:58)
• Whether Ends Justify Means (6:58–12:30)
• Means Shape Ends (12:30–16:47)
• Truthy, or Truly? (16:47–21:07)
• Conclusion (21:07–22:10)

<li><em>Noah</em> (18:45–26:06) – all art, not so much on the textual fidelity. We might be okay with that.</li>

<li>“Heaven Thrown In” (26:06–31:04) – on how aiming to start a conversation sometimes has the opposite effect, and how making good art sometimes produces a great conversation.</li>
