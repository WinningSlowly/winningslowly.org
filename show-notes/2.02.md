### Show Notes

In which we talk about Marco Arment, Kirby Delauter, and the general phenomenon
of things you say on the internet going viral (often when you least expect them
to). How do you deal with the reality that your audience is *never* limited but
may universalize at any moment? What is the audience's responsibility, and what
are creators' responsibilities? How do we deal charitably with authors writing
"in-house" on controversial topics?

P.S. You're going to want to listen to the bloopers on this one, all the way
through to the end. Trust us.
