### Show Notes

We talk *libraries*. Why? Because public libraries are *awesome*. They're on of the few unalloyed successes in social experiments. They do good in a wide array of areas, and they're free to use (because we support them as taxpayers). If you want to hear Chris giddy, this is the episode.

The second of two episodes recorded live at NC State University on September 22, 2016. (Yep, our schedule is *way* different this year. You can thank Stephen's Ph.D. thesis and the combination of Chris' M. Div., work, and travel for that!)
