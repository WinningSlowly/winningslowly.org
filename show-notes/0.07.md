### Show Notes

In which we talk about the Affordable Care Act and how implementation---both at
a technological level and at a general political level---public perception, and
policy combine in strange and surprising ways.

#### Chapters

  - Intro and Overview (2:45)
  - Technology Failure (2:45--8:36): on how the initial failure of
    [HealthCare.gov][hc.g] shaped public perception of the ACA.
  - Implementation Matters (8:36--15:58): on how policy in general is always
    dependent on how it is put in place.
  - Conclusion (17:28)
