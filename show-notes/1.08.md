### Show Notes

In which we talk about the drive to publish all the time and the value of
publishing more substantive content at a slower pace. We talk about the way the
internet has driven us toward rapid-fire publishing models and how long-form and
high-quality content is difficult (if not impossible) to publish on this model.
We look at how to build an audience via quality and the slow route instead of
the click-driven model, note that this is difficult to sustain as a means of
income, and even think a bit about the history of long-form and serial
publishing.
