### Show Notes

In which we ask: What exactly *is* art? Specifically, is photography art? But
more generally, can anyone actually define art? How does the difficulty in
defining art affect the makers of art, and why do people spend so much time
trying to draw lines around it? How have democratizing forces changed the nature
of art in the last few decades, and what does that bode for our future?

### Before You Go

N.B. In addition to the clarifications Stephen offered, we should note that
Chris' initial description overstated the case a bit. The law did not
technically *forbid* classes from teaching AP US History. It just, you know...
promised to *defund* the teaching thereof.
