Summary: >
    We discuss the epistemology of the book: where we agree with it, where we disagree with it. We also assess the convincing and unconvincing parts of her arguments, concluding with thoughts on how to learn from things we don't fully agree with and effective interdisciplinarity.

### Show Notes

* [Critical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory)
* [Critical race theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_race_theory)
* [Black feminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_feminism)

* [White as default in AI](https://www.businessinsider.com/depixelator-turned-obama-white-illustrates-racial-bias-in-ai-2020-6), potentially due to biased/non-diverse training data
* [_Finding God in the Lord of the Rings_](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Finding_God_in_the_Lord_of_the_Rings)
* [_Looking for God in Harry Potter_](https://www.amazon.com/Looking-Harry-Potter-John-Granger/dp/1414300913)
* [Surveillance Studies](http://web.mit.edu/gtmarx/www/surv_studies.pdf)
* [David Hume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume)The two main subjects we mentioned on the show as relevant were [critical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory) (and specifically [critical race theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_race_theory)) and [surveillance studies](https://www.surveillance-studies.net/?page_id=119). Notably, while Browne describes herself as a [black feminist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_feminism) and makes reference to the adjacent idea of [intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality), she never explicitly refers to critical (race) theory. *We* applied the term to her work based on the historical and interpretive methods she used.

Reminder: as noted in 8.12, Stephen was *definitely* recording from a closet and some of his level drops are a result of (potentially) getting hit in the face with a sweater:
