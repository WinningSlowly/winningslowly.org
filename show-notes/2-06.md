### Show Notes

In which we talk about how companies have to deal with the inherent leak-ability of digital media, especially things like movie trailers. How *should* Marvel respond to whoever leaked the first Age of Ultron trailer? Stephen and Chris have a friendly disagreement about the best way to respond to this kind of thing.

Today's blooper section is... amazing.

Alternate title we ultimately decided not to foist upon you: MPAAwful. You can thank Stephen for that one (as well as the much better actual title!)

    > Marvel is seeking out the person responsible for a leak not of a script or of a movie, but of a trailer. Yes, Marvel’s executives are taking matters to the courts because people were able to watch about two minutes of footage that looked like every other Marvel trailer — fireballs and terrified citizens, heroes with far-off gazes and narration by an evil nemesis — before the company was ready for people to see it.
