### Show Notes

Chris and Stephen use the news of communications tool Slack's recent hacking incident to discuss the nature of digital security. Along the way we make a plea for candy, claim that almost all companies are digital companies now, offer some security tips to our listeners, and deliver a long bloopers reel. We hope we induce just enough paranoia to get things moving in your security life, but not too much.

*Note*: The [digital divide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide) primarily has to do with socio-economic issues of development in rich and poor areas. Our BYG discussion points out the structural corporate collusion that enables the digital divide, which may not have been entirely clear.
