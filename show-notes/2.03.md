### Show Notes

In which we look at Zoë Keating's ongoing kerfuffle with YouTube. Is YouTube strong-arming indie artists? Should megacorporations force all their clients---customer and producer---to fit in a one-size-fits-all setup, or should they take the long view and do what is best not only for the bottom line but also for the relationship between artist and audience. Oh, and what about those monopolies and monopsonies? They might have some extra ethical responsibility, too!
